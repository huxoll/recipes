# The Yummy Salmon Recipe

## Ingredients

1. 4-20 oz. Slab o' Salmon
2. 1 cSoy Sauce (Reduced salt for ever so slightly healthier version)
3. 1/2 c Sugar

## Recipe

1. Place salmon in a baking vessel, deep enough to cover the fish and room for slop.  
2. Cover with soy sauce (I know, it uses a lot, but it'll be OK.)
3. Add sugar slowly and stir it in until it stops dissolving.
4. Marinate for at least 30 minutes.
5. Preheat oven to 425F.
6. If desired, pour off excess marinate until there's just a 1/4" or so left in the pan
6. Cook for 23 minutes, or until meat thermometer in the center reads 145 deg F.

When done right, this makes a slightly sweet, slightly salty glaze and is delicious all the way through.
